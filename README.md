# Spam_Emails

## Information

Machine Learning can help us make our lives easier. One example of this is spam emails. 
Being able for the computer to decide whether or not the email is legitimate or 
a scam is very important and can save a lot of people. So this quick presentation will 
show the steps of creating a spam email detector and you are free to download the code to test 
different outputs.
